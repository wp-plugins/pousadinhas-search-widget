== Description ==

With our WordPress plug-in you can easily provide online pousada booking search for your visitors via the Pousadinhas Search Widget.

The widget can target either a region/place or a specific pousada which must be specified in the 'Destination' field.
In order to specify the target, use the full slug/path for its URL at http://www.pousadinhas.com.br/, for example:
If you would like to target the search to Pousada Cantares -- which is located at http://www.pousadinhas.com.br/tiradentes/pousada+cantares -- fill the 'Destination' field with 'tiradentes/pousada+cantares'. 

This plugin is a simple wrapper to our native Search Widget.
